Learning Distance Metrics
=========================
*learning_dist_metrics* is a Python module implementating the supervised learning distance metrics algorithm introduced in 
the [paper](http://ai.stanford.edu/~ang/papers/nips02-metric.pdf), which is co-authored by [Eric P. Xing](), [Andrew Y. Ng](), [Micheal I. Jordan]() and [Start Russell](). To deliver a consistent programming style, the algorithm is developed by following API design protocols which is deopted by [scikit-learn](http://orbi.ulg.ac.be/bitstream/2268/154357/1/paper.pdf), the one of most popular machine learning module in Python.

How to Install: 
===============
The algorithm is still in packaging process. To use it, download the module from the repository and include the folder under the root directory of your application.
